# Lab exercise 2 objectives
1. Implement programs that use classes to instantiate and use objects.
2. Use member functions of an object to modify its member variables.

# Instructions
Answer the programming problems sequentially (i.e., answer prob01 before prob02). 
If you have questions let your instructor or the lab assistant know. You can also consult your classmates.

To get started on problem 1, change into the `prob01` directory. If you haven't already, change into the lab02 directory:
```
cd lab02-<YOUR_USERNAME>
```

Then change into the prob01 folder and view the README for its instructions:
```
cd prob01
```
